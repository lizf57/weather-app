# Weather Dashboard ⛅️

## Challenge 6: Server-Side APIs

For this week's challenge, I created a weather dashboard that retrieves data from a third-party API using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and the Open Weather API.

The purpose of this application is to allow a user/traveler to see the weather outlook for mulitple cities so that the user can plan a trip accordingly. The weather dashboard includes form inputs to search for a city and in return, gives the user a 5 day forecast of the weather. 

The requirements for the assignment are listed below:
- When I search for a city, I'm presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history.
- When I view current weather conditions for that city, I'm presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
- When I view future weather conditions for that city, I'm presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- When I click on a city in the search history, I'm presented with current and future conditions for that city.
